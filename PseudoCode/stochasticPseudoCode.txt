###SET OF CANDIDATES
Input G : Graph ; Input NumSens : number ; Verts : set of objects ;
VertsEdge : set objects ; VertsTarget : set of objects ;
###OTHER INTERMEDIATE AND OUTPUT SETS
C : set of objects ; Output S : set of objects
    ###INITIALIZATION
    S = empty; i = 0
    Initialize C
    Main Loop, while i < 50
        Find and remove duplicate candidates in C
        ###EVALUATION
        Evaluate all members of C
        ###SELECTION
        Select those members of C that will be allowed to persist
        ###CROSSOVER
        Crossover 10 randomly chosen members of C
        i = i + 1
    Endloop
    ###SOLUTION
    Select fittest c in C
    Determine likelihood of each edge in c
    place n most likely edges in c into S
    return S

    Func Initialize
        Randomly create 50 candidates and add them to C
        For each canditate c in C
            ###FEASIBILITY
            While c is not feasible
                ###REPAIR
                repair c
            Endwhile
            Evalaute fitness of c
            Generate reduction graph of c
        Endfor
    Endfunc

    Func Repair
        Randomly choose allele in gene string of c
        If allele = 1
            change allele to 0
        Else if allele = 0
            move down gene string to first 1 value, change to 0
        Endif Endif
    Endfunc

    ###CROSSOVER
    Func Crossover
        create new gene by bitwise OR of parent genes
        ###MUTATION
        mutate gene
        generate reduction graph of c
        ###FEASIBILITY
        While not feasible
            ###REPAIR
            repair c
            recreate reduction graph
        Endwhile
        evaluate fitness of c
        add c to C
    Endfunc
